### :man_technologist: About me:

I am a beginner front-end developer<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/WUlplcMpOCEmTGBtBW/giphy.gif" width="30px">. My path in IT began with a web development marathon. After the marathon I tried myself in many directions, tried to learn C#/.NET, Python, but I was more interested in web development! Since December 2022, I have been studying front-end courses at IT Step Academy. At the moment I am studying at courses and looking for a job at the same time!
